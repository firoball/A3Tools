1.) SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
=======================

THE LORD OF LIGHTNING is almost working on each PC, but if you're an owner of a PC
below the system requirements you will get a nice slide show.

required:                        recommended:

486 DX4/100                      Pentium 100
8MB RAM                          32MB RAM
SVGA graphics                    SVGA graphics
mouse                            3-button mouse
5MB HD space available           10MB HD space available
DOS (only if you've PKUNZIP!)    Windows 95

This game was not made for Windows 95! But normally it works under Windows 95 without any
problems. Though it's possible that the game speed will be very slow and/or
there will be sound problems (see below). For that reason it's recommended that you play
THE LORD OF LIGHTNING under DOS, particularly if you've a PC with not much RAM (8MB or
16MB).


2.) STARTING THE GAME
=====================

 Under Windows 95 you've different possibilities to start THE LORD OF LIGHTNING:
 You can start the game in the Explorer, for example, by clicking on the file name

 LL_run.bat

 or by starting the DOS window and typing the file name 

 LL_run.bat

 in the LORD OF LIGHTNING subdirectory where you unpacked the files.



3.) PROBLEMS
============

 a.) WINDOWS 95
 -----------------------

 Q: I'm not able to hear any background song (midi).
 A: If you don't get a message 'Adlib/OPL2 activated for music' while starting
    THE LORD OF LIGHTNING your soundcard was not correctly recognized.
    Make sure that your soundcard does not cause any hardware conflicts.
    A few soundcards refuse to play anything under MS-DOS,
    if you've played music before, e.g. with the multimedia-player.
    That's an error of Windows 95 and haven't anything to do with THE LORD OF
    LIGHTNING. Simply restart your PC.

 Q: The game is very slow! What can I do to power it up?!
 A: Exit Windows 95 in the MS-DOS mode and start the game.
    Another way:
    Press the F5 key while running THE LORD OF LIGHTNING.
    The motionblur is now activated. You get a blurred picture while moving the player.
    That makes the game faster!


 b.) MS-DOS
 -------------------

 Q: The mouse isn't working! What shall I do?!
 A: Make sure that you've loaded a mouse driver (look in the autoexec.bat file).
    To exit THE LORD OF LIGHTNING press CTRL-ALT-DEL if there's no mouse
    (the PC won't restart).

 Q: The game is very slow! What can I do to power it up?!
 A: Press  the F5-Key while running THE LORD OF LIGHTNING.
    The motion blur is now activated. You get a blurred picture while moving the player.
    That makes the game faster!



4.) JOYSTICK
============

You can also play THE LORD OF LIGHTNING with a joystick.
But it can cause a strange trembling of the player under Windows 95.
So, it's better to use the joystick only under MS-DOS.
To start THE LORD OF LIGHTNING WITH joystick support doubleclick the file 'LL_jrun'.
