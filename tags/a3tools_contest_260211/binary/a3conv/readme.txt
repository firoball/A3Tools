A3 map converter
----------------

[a3conv.exe]

This folder contains a compiled version of the
A3 map converter.
Some sample config files are included.

In order to start a sample, run any of the
.bat files for different exampel levels.

The .bat files start the engine with -cfg xxx.ini
as parameter. This way a config file can be
specified.

Feel free to change the config files to load
different levels at different scales and export
WM3 with different file names.

If no config file is given via parameter, the
map converter will search for config.ini and run it
by default.

Always run a3conv.exe. Running a3convmap.exe might 
result in palette errors.

The conversion process may take a while. Just wait
a while before hastily shutting down the converter
via task manager!
