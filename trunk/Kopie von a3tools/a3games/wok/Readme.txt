*Known Bugs*

-Under certain circumstances, after you used an item, the weapons don't work correctly
 anymore. To fix this problem, select the weapon in your backpack and press ENTER.
 (I have no idea what exactly is the trigger for that, but it is related to the inventory)

-The player's rotating and the jumps may appear a bit jerky on fast PCs (MMX & PII)

-A sound plays when trying to set an hotkey to an item or an armor. When pressing this
 hotkey afterwards the sound plays again, but nothing else happens (minor bug).

-Never try to read the sign while falling into the hole right before it. If you do that
 the game might get stuck after loading the new map. Press F10 to quit and restart the
 game after this happened.

-Don't change weapons while pressing CTRL. Will cause a strange effect. Related to the
 weapon animation actions.

-Sometimes the ghosts ignore you even if you are right before them. I can't find the bug,
 please write me your possible solutions!!
