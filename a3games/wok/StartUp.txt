*The main controls*

After starting the game, choose OPTIONS if you want to change the settings.
With the ESC-key you can return to the Main Menu. Then choose NEW GAME.

You'll find yourself in a dark forest, without any items or weapons.
Use the arrow keys to move, A (middle mouse button x2)to jump and Z (=Y on German keyboards)
(middle mouse button x1) to duck.

Now go to the sword that is lying on the ground before you. When collecting it you'll
hear a short sound. Press F6 to open the Backpack. The sword should be already selected.
With PGUP and PGDN you can scroll through your backpack. To equip an item or to put it into
the Inventory in the status bar, press HOME. The sword should appear on the right side of
your screen. Use the CTRL-key (or left mouse-button) to attack.
Now walk around the corner. You'll see a ghost from behind. Hold down the SHIFT-key and
sneak to it until you're near enough to hit it. Sometimes it will notice you, but most
times it won't...ghosts are stupid. Then attack. The ghost will flee and then start an
attack on you. Hit it before it hits you and the ghost will flee again. It should be no
problem for you to kill those ghosts.
You'll come to a hollow tree soon. Jump over it and collect the yellow potion hidden in the
corner. To use it, open the Backpack using F6, then select it and press ENTER. If you don't
need it or if you have any reason to drop it, use D. But be careful. You can also drop your
weapon or important items. If an item is dropped it is GONE, so use this feature with care!

If you want to activate doors, switches, or just read signs, use the SPACE bar or the
right mouse button.

Now you should be able to play the game. I didn't mention every key in this small tutorial,
but I don't wanna take you the fun discovering some other things.
If you have any problems while playing, just press the F1-key and you'll get a listing of
all keys used in the game.
